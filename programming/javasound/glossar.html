			The world of electronic music and audio has a long list of acronyms and 
            phrases that can be difficult to figure out. This glossary is a 
            great place to check when you come across a term you don't 
            understand on The Sonic Spot or in any other electronic music and 
            audio related material. 
            <P>If you are looking for a term that doesn't appear in the 
            glossary, please submit the new term and the definition will be 
            added and e-mailed to you. <BR clear=all>

            <P><B>ADSR</B><A name=adsr></A>- see <A href="#envelope"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Envelope</FONT></A>. <A name=aliasing></A>
            <P><B>Aliasing</B> - a type of distortion that occurs when digitally 
            recording high frequencies with a low sample rate. A visual analogy 
            can be found in video, when a car's wheels appear to slowly spin 
            backwards while the car is quickly moving forward. Similarly when 
            you try to record a frequency greater than one half of the sampling 
            rate (Nyquist Frequency), instead of hearing a high pitch you may 
            hear a low frequency rumble. An anti-aliasing filter can be used to 
            remove high-frequencies before recording. However, once a sound has 
            been recorded, aliasing distortion is impossible to remove without 
            also removing other frequencies from the sound. <A name=arpeggiator></A>
            <P><B>Arpeggiator</B> - a device that sequentially plays a pattern 
            of notes over a range of the keyboard. The speed of the arpeggiation 
            and pattern of notes are variable depending on the tempo and 
            specified/pressed notes. <A name=attack></A>
            <P><B>Attack</B> - the initial period of a typical <A href="#envelope"><FONT 
            color=#000000>envelope</FONT></A> during which a sound's attribute 
            (such as volume) increases from 0 (silence) to it's maximum amount. 
            The length of the attack determines how "soft" or "harsh" a sound 
            is. For example, most drum or percussion sounds have a short 
            amplitude attack time and thus have a sudden "harsh" start. A string 
            sound usually has a long amplitude attack and thus has a "soft" 
            start and eases in. <A name=bandpassfilter></A>
            <P><B>Bandpass Filter</B> - a type of <A href="#filter"></A><FONT 
            color=#000000>filter</FONT></A> used to eliminate high- and 
            low-range frequencies around a specific frequency, resulting in more 
            distinctive sound. <A name=bit-depth></A>
            <P><B>Bit/Bit-Depth</B> - often used to describe the resolution or 
            quality of each sample in a digital audio stream. It is the number 
            of bits (0's and 1's) used to describe the amplitude or volume of an 
            audio signal at a specific point in time. The higher the number, the 
            more precisely the original or intended audio signal can be 
            (re)produced. See <A href="audio_digital.html">Digital 
            Audio Basics</A> for a more detailed explination. 
            <P><B>BPF</B> - see <A href="#bandpassfilter"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Bandpass Filter</FONT></A>. <A name=cddb></A>
            <P><B>CDDB</B> - A huge online database of audio CD information 
            including album, artist, song names and more. Information is added 
            and retreived by users of CDDB enabled software, allowing the 
            database to continually grow. Building on the original database, 
            CDDB<SUP>2</SUP> enables expanded album and track-by-track credits, 
            genres, web-links, segments and more. You can learn more about CDDB 
            and CDDB<SUP>2</SUP> including programming information at 
            <A href="http://www.cddb.com/">http://www.cddb.com/</A>. <A name=chorus></A>
            <P><B>Chorus</B> - an audio effect used to "expand" or "thicken" a 
            sound by playing multiple versions of the input signal with slightly 
            different delays and changes in pitch simulating an ensemble of the 
            input sound. <A name=codec></A>
            <P><B>Codec</B> - stands for coder/decoder. Codecs are often used by 
            software to compress and decompress audio data. For example, most 
            Windows computers have an ADPCM codec which many software 
            applications use to read and write compressed audio data from ADPCM 
            compressed WAV files. You can view the codecs installed in Windows 
            by going to Control Panel &gt; Multimedia &gt; Devices Tab &gt; 
            Audio Compression Codecs. <A name=dat></A>
            <P><B>DAT</B> - Digital Audio Tape. A tape-based digital audio 
            recording and playback system, developed by Sony, which use a 
            sampling rate of 48 kHz (slightly higher than CDs, which use 44.1 
            kHz). <A name=decay></A>
            <P><B>Decay</B> - the period of an <A href="#envelope"><FONT 
            color=#000000>envelope</FONT></A> during which a sound's attribute 
            (such as volume) stabilizes after the <A href="#attack"><FONT 
            color=#000000>attack</FONT></A> has completed. When the sound 
            attribute reaches the end of it's decay, it has reached the <A href="#sustain"><FONT 
            color=#000000>sustain</FONT></A> period. <A name=delay></A>
            <P><B>Delay</B> - an effect that is used to add depth or space to an 
            audio signal by repeating the input one or more times after a brief 
            pause of a few milliseconds to a few seconds. Delay is also often 
            referred to as <A href="#echo"><FONT 
            color=#000000>echo</FONT></A>. <A name=directxplugin></A>
            <P><B>DirectX Plug-In</B> - a program that uses Microsoft's DirectX 
            technology to obtain digital audio samples which are then 
            manipulated by applying reverb, compression or some other type of 
            audio signal effect. The output signal may be rendered off-line or 
            generated in real-time while the plug-in's host program performs 
            playback. See <A href="#plugin"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Plug-In</FONT></A> for more details. <A name=dsp></A>
            <P><B>DSP</B> - <B>D</B>igital <B>S</B>ignal <B>P</B>rocessing uses 
            mathmatics to operate on a digital signal (such as a digital audio 
            stream) to generate some type of altered output. DSP is used heavily 
            in software and hardware effects processing. DSP chips are found on 
            an increasing number of <A href="#soundcard"><FONT 
            color=#000000>sound cards</FONT></A> to provide extra audio 
            processing power and help relieve the computers CPU of this type of 
            work, much like a 3D graphics accelerator would for rendering 3D 
            graphics. <A name=echo></A>
            <P><B>Echo</B> - a very basic effect produced by repeating a sound 
            with a delay long enough to be heard as a separate event. It is 
            often just called <A href="#delay"><FONT 
            color=#000000>delay</FONT></A> and is usually used to add more depth 
            to an audio signal without the muddiness often introduced by <A href="#reverb"><FONT 
            color=#000000>reverb</FONT></A>. <A name=envelope></A>
            <P><B>Envelope</B> - used in sound synthesis to control the volume, 
            pan, pitch or other attribute of sound over a period of time. ADSR 
            envelopes are the most commonly used type of envelope. They are 
            divided into several segments, <A href="#attack"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Attack</FONT></A>, <A href="#decay"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Decay</FONT></A>, <A href="#sustain"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Sustain</FONT></A> and <A href="#release"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Release</FONT></A>. The attack segment is often 
            triggered by pressing a keyboard note. The envelope continues and 
            holds the sustain level until the keyboard note is released, which 
            causes the release segment to finish the envelope.

            width=320></CENTER><A name=equalizer></A>
            <P><B>Equalizer (EQ)</B> - a device used to cut and boost individual 
            frequencies of an audio signal using a number of filters. The name 
            "equalizer" comes from the original application of correcting 
            distorted audio signals to sound closer to the original source. <A href="#graphicequalizer"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Graphic</FONT></A> and <A href="#parametricequalizer"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Parametric</FONT></A> are different types of 
            equalizers used by audio equipment and software <A href="#plugin"><FONT 
            color=#000000>plug-ins</FONT></A>. <A name=fileformat></A>
            <P><B>File Format</B> - the structure that defines how data is 
            organized in a software file used to store information about a 
            sample, musical score, etc. A standardized file format makes it 
            possible for different software programs to share the same 
            information. See the <A href="file_formats.html">Music and 
            Audio File Formats Guide</A> for more details, including information 
            about specific file formats. <A name=filter></A>
            <P><B>Filter</B> - a function that cuts off a specific frequency 
            band to change a sounds brightness, thickness and other qualities. A 
            few common filter types are <A href="#lowpassfilter"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Low-pass</FONT></A>, <A href="#highpassfilter"><FONT 
            color=#000000>High-pass</FONT></A> and <A href="#bandpassfilter"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Bandpass</FONT></A>. <A name=flanger></A>
            <P><B>Flanger</B> - an audio effect created by varying a slight 
            delay between two identical audio signals that results in a sound 
            similar to a jet airplane taking off or landing. <A name=fullduplex></A>
            <P><B>Full-Duplex</B> - the ability to send and receive data 
            simultaneously which, in digital audio terms, translates to being 
            able to play and record audio at the same time. Many sequencing and 
            multi-track recording programs use a sound card's full-duplex 
            capabilities to allow recording to a new track while playing back 
            previously recorded tracks for reference. Most modern sound cards 
            are full-duplex, but many of the older ones are only able to record 
            or play audio at different times. They are said to be "<A href="#halfduplex"><FONT 
            color=#000000>half-duplex</FONT></A>". <A name=graphicequalizer></A>
            <P><B>Graphic Equalizer</B> - a type of <A href="#equalizer"><FONT 
            color=#000000>equalizer</FONT></A> that provides control over a 
            fixed set of frequencies. Each filter provides linear cut/boost 
            control over a fixed frequency. The number of filters on graphic 
            equalizers range from three (low, mid, high) to well over eleven. 
            While graphic equalizers generally have more filters than <A href="#parametricequalizer"><FONT 
            color=#000000>parametric equalizers</FONT></A>, they are less 
            flexible, in that the individual filter frequencies are not 
            adjustable. <A name=halfduplex></A>
            <P><B>Half-Duplex</B> - the inability to send and receive data 
            simultaneously which, in digital audio terms, translates to the 
            inability to record and play audio at the same time. Many older 
            sound cards are half-duplex. Most modern sound cards are capable of 
            recording and playing audio simultaneously. This capability is 
            called "<A href="#fullduplex"><FONT 
            color=#000000>full-duplex</FONT></A>". <A name=highpassfilter></A>
            <P><B>High-pass Filter</B> - a type of <A href="#filter"><FONT 
            color=#000000>filter</FONT></A> used to eliminate low-range 
            frequencies resulting in a crisper sound, good for creating 
            percussion sounds with distinctive high ranges. 
            <P><B>HPF</B> - see <A href="#highpassfilter"><FONT 
            color=#000000>High-pass Filter</FONT></A>. 
            <P><B>LFO</B> - see <A href="#lfo"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Low Frequency Oscillator</FONT></A>. <A name=lfo></A>
            <P><B>Low Frequency Oscillator</B> - used in sound synthesis to 
            modulate a sound attribute such as volume at an audibly slow rate. 
            <A name=lowpassfilter></A>
            <P><B>Low-pass Filter</B> - a type of <A href="#filter"><FONT 
            color=#000000>filter</FONT></A> used to eliminate high-range 
            frequencies resulting in a rounder sound. 
            <P><B>LPF</B> - see <A href="#lowpassfilter"><FONT

            <P><B>MIDI</B> - <B>M</B>usical <B>I</B>nstrument <B>D</B>igital 
            <B>I</B>nterface provides a standardized method for MIDI devices 
            such as synthesizers, samplers, sound cards, etc. to communicate 
            musical events and data to each other. See the <A href="midi_guide.html">MIDI Guide</A> for a 
            detailed explanation. <A name=midiinterface></A>
            <P><B>MIDI Interface</B> - a hardware interface that is either 
            inserted into one of the computer's internal expansion slots or 
            plugged into a computer (serial/parallel) port. It allows the 
            computer to communicate with other MIDI instruments by adding one or 
            more MIDI input and output ports. <A name=mixer></A>
            <P><B>Mixer</B> - a hardware or software device that combines 
            multiple audio signals into one destination signal. Mixers usually 
            provide control over the volume and/or stereo balance of each source 
            signal. <A name=modulation></A>
            <P><B>Modulation</B> - the fast oscillation of one or more operators 
            or sound waves of a synthesized sound. Commonly used in FM synthesis 
            to add some complexity and texture to a sound. Many MIDI controllers 
            and keyboards provide a specific wheel or slider for controlling the 
            modulation of an instrument sound (often referred to as the 
            mod-wheel). <A name=monophonic></A>
            <P><B>Monophonic</B> - only one note of an instrument may be played 
            at a time. An instrument that can play many at once is said to be <A href="#polyphonic"><FONT 
            color=#000000>polyphonic</FONT></A>. Monophonic instruments usually 
            cut-off the sound of previously played note with the start of new 
            one. <A name=monotimbral></A>
            <P><B>Monotimbral</B> - only one instrument sound (<A href="#timbre"><FONT 
            color=#000000>timbre</FONT></A>) may be played at a time. Older 
            synthesizers were often monotimbral before sequencers where 
            invented, which enables musicians to play multiple parts on the same 
            instrument. A monotimbral synthesizer may be able to play multiple 
            notes of the one instrument sound simultaneously. <A name=multitimbral></A>
            <P><B>Multitimbral</B> - more than one instrument sound (<A href="#timbre"><FONT 
            color=#000000>timbre</FONT></A>) may be played at the same time. 
            Most modern synthesisers, samplers and sound cards have this 
            capability. A musical device that is not multitimbral is said to be 
            <A href="#monotimbral"><FONT 
            color=#000000>monotimbral</FONT></A>. <A name=oscillator></A>
            <P><B>Oscillator</B> - a synthesis module used to create a cyclical 
            waveform. These simple waveforms may then be passed through other 
            modules (<A href="#lfo"><FONT 
            color=#000000>LFOs</FONT></A>, <A href="#envelope"><FONT 
            color=#000000>envelopes</FONT></A>, etc.) to add some character. See 
            the <A href="synthesis.html">Sound 
            Synthesis Guide</A> for more details. <A name=parametricequalizer></A>
            <P><B>Parametric Equalizer</B> - a type of <A href="#equalizer"><FONT 
            color=#000000>equalizer</FONT></A> that provides control over each 
            filter's frequency and the amount of cut or boost of each filter. 
            Typically, parametric equalizer's provide three to four filters that 
            work in parallel, each one filtering a different frequency of the 
            spectrum (i.e. low, mid, high). While parametric equalizers 
            generally have fewer filters than a <A href="#graphicequalizer"><FONT 
            color=#000000>graphic equalizer</FONT></A>, they are more flexible 
            and provide finer control, due to the adjustability of the filtered 
            frequencies. <A name=patch></A>
            <P><B>Patch</B> - refers to an instrument sound, program or voice on 
            a synthesizer or sampler. This term comes from the roots of hardware 
            synthesis, where physical cables where used to connect and route 
            signals in a matrix to create a unique sound (same concept as phone 
            operators "patching" a call through, back in the day). <A name=plugin></A>
            <P><B>Plug-In</B> - a "client program" that is used to expand the 
            functionality of a "host program", such as a sequencer or digital 
            audio editor. The host provides the plug-in with some type of input 
            data such as digital audio samples, which is then processed to 
            generate new output, such as effected digital audio. A plug-in is 
            often run seamlessly from within a host program appearing to be part 
            of the standard interface. One plug-in can be used by multiple host 
            programs that share the same plug-in format. Two popular plug-in 
            formats used in computer music and audio are <A href="#directxplugin"><FONT 
            color=#000000>DirectX</FONT></A> and <A href="#vstplugin"><FONT 
            color=#000000>VST</FONT></A> digital audio plug-ins. <A name=polyphonic></A>
            <P><B>Polyphonic</B> - more than one note of an instrument sound may 
            be played at the same time. Hardware and software synthesizers 
            usually range from 1 to 128 notes polyphony. The number specifies 
            exactly how many notes may be played at once before cutting-off 
            previously played notes. An instrument that can play only one is 
            said to be <A href="#monophonic"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Monophonic</FONT></A>. <A name=polytimbral></A>
            <P><B>Polytimbral</B> - more than one instrument sound (<A href="#timbre"><FONT 
            color=#000000>timbre</FONT></A>) may be played at the same time. <A href="#multitimbral"><FONT 
            color=#000000>Multitimbral</FONT></A> is the more commonly used term 
            for this functionality. <A name=potentiometer></A>
            <P><B>Potentiometer (Pot)</B> - a variable resistor (rotary or 
            linear) used to control volume, tone, or other function of an 
            electronic device. <A name=release></A>
            <P><B>Release</B> - the final period of an <A href="#envelope"><FONT 
            color=#000000>envelope</FONT></A> during which a sound's attribute 
            (such as volume) decreases from the <A href="#sustain"><FONT 
            color=#000000>sustain</FONT></A> level to 0 (silence). The release 
            period is usually started upon releasing a keyboard's note. This 
            period of the envelope defines how a sound finishes off. A long 
            release time causes a sound's attribute to fade away slowly, while a 
            short release time causes it to drop out quickly. <A name=resample></A>
            <P><B>Resample</B> - to recalculate <A href="#sample"><FONT 
            color=#000000>samples</FONT></A> in a sound file at a different <A href="#samplerate"><FONT 
            color=#000000>rate</FONT></A> than the file was originally recorded. 
            If a sample is resampled at a lower rate, sample values are removed 
            from the sound file, decreasing its size, but also decreasing its 
            available frequency range and possibly introducing <A href="#aliasing"><FONT 
            color=#000000>aliasing</FONT></A>. Resampling to a higher sample 
            rate, often interpolates extra sample values into the sound file. 
            This increases the size of the sound file but may not increase the 
            quality (depends on the algorithm used). <A name=reverb></A>
            <P><B>Reverb</B> - an effect that simulates natural reverberations 
            (sound reflections) that occur in different rooms and environments 
            to create an ambience or sense of spaciousness. <A name=rip></A>
            <P><B>Rip</B> - to extract or copy data from one format to another 
            more useful format. The most common example is found in the phrase 
            "CD Ripping" which means to copy audio tracks from an ordinary audio 
            CD and save them to hard disk as a WAV, MP3 or other audio file, 
            which can then be played, edited or written back to another CD. <A name=sample></A>
            <P><B>Sample</B> - a sound or short piece of audio stored digitally 
            in a computer, synthesizer or <A href="#sampler"><FONT 
            color=#000000>sampler</FONT></A>. The word sample may refer to 
            either a single moment in a digital audio stream (the smallest piece 
            of data used to represent an audio signal at a given time) or a 
            complete sound or digital audio stream made up of a collection of 
            individual samples. For a more detailed explanation of samples, see 
            <A href="audio_digital.html">Digital 
            Audio Basics</A>. <A name=sampler></A>
            <P><B>Sampler</B> - a hardware device or software application that 
            uses <A href="#sample"><FONT 
            color=#000000>samples</FONT></A> as it's main method of generating 
            it's audio output. Samplers often use a number of samples together 
            to create realistic sounding reproductions of real sounds and 
            musical instruments. For more details on this technique, see 
            <A href="synthesis_types.html#wavetable">Wavetable 
            Synthesis</A>. <A name=samplerate></A>
            <P><B>Sample Rate</B> - the resolution of digital audio that 
            determines it's sound quality. When audio is digitally recorded 
            (digitized), it must be converted into a series of <A href="#sample"><FONT 
            color=#000000>samples</FONT></A> which can be stored in memory or on 
            disk. The sample rate defines how many samples are recorded per 
            second of audio input and is measured in Hz (Hertz, cycles per 
            second) and kHz (Kilohertz, thousand cycles per second). Click the 
            examples below to hear the difference between a few commonly used 
            sample rates. 
            <P><B>Sequencer</B><A name=sequencer></A>- a hardware device, software application 
            or module used to arrange (ie. sequence) timed events into some order. 
            In digital audio and music, sequencers are used to record and 
            arrange MIDI and/or audio events into patterns and musical 
            compositions. <A name=signaltonoiseratio></A>
            <P><B>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</B> - "Signal" refers to the useful or 
            "pure" information found in a an audio stream or other medium, and 
            "noise" to anything else. The ratio of these is usually expressed 
            logarithmically, in decibels. Signal-to-Noise Ratio is sometimes 
            abbreviated as SNR, s/n ratio and s:n ratio. A high SNR translates 
            to a "cleaner" signal. <A name=soundcard></A>
            <P><B>Sound Card</B> - a hardware interface that is either built 
            into a computer's motherboard or inserted into one of the computer's 
            internal expansion slots. Sound cards allow the computer to play 
            digital audio and/or musical instrument sounds. Many sound cards 
            also provide a <A href="#midiinterface"><FONT 
            color=#000000>MIDI interface</FONT></A>. <A name=sustain></A>
            <P><B>Sustain</B> - the period of an <A href="#envelope"><FONT 
            color=#000000>envelope</FONT></A> during which a sound's attribute 
            (such as volume) holds at a constant level. The sustain period 
            starts at the end of the <A href="#decay"><FONT 
            color=#000000>decay</FONT></A> period and holds until the <A href="#release"><FONT 
            color=#000000>release</FONT></A> period is started (usually by a 
            keyboard note release). Unlike the other periods of an envelope, the 
            sustain period does not have a slope because it must be capable of 
            holding indefinitely (as long as a keyboard note is pressed). <A name=syncopate></A>
            <P><B>Syncopate</B> - to shift the regular accent of a tone or beat 
            by beginning on an unaccented beat and continuing through the next 
            accented beat. <A name=timbre></A>
            <P><B>Timbre</B> - the characteristics that differentiate one 
            instrument, voice or sound from another. It can be thought of as the 
            texture or characteristics that define a sound. Notes of the same 
            pitch and volume may have a different timbre. In electronic music, 
            timbre sometimes refers to a synthesizer voice or patch (see <A href="#multitimbral"><FONT

            <P><B>VCD</B> - a <B>V</B>ideo <B>CD</B> is a compact disc which 
            stores video and audio compressed using MPEG-1 file format 
            technology. Movies are generally compressed to around 352x240 pixels 
            (NTSC) resulting in about 1 GB of data, which spans over two CDs. 
            While they aren't common in the USA, VCDs are more common in other 
            countries where many popular electronics companies sell dedicated 
            VCD players. DVD technology surpasses the quality of VCD technology, 
            mostly due to the increased storage capacity of DVD media.

            <P><B>Vocoder</B> - an audio effect that produces "robotic" sounding 
            results when processing vocal input. It uses an algorithm called <A href="synthesis_types.html#rm">ring 
            modulation</A> to produce the effect. Examples can be found in some 
            disco and modern music, such as the Beastie Boys' "Intergalactic".
            <P><B>Voltage-Controlled Amplifier</B><A name=vca></A>- an audio signal amplifier 
            whose output is controlled by voltage (instead of a <A href="#potentiometer"><FONT

            <P><B>Voltage-Controlled Filter</B> - a filter whose cutoff 
            frequency and resonant frequency is adjusted using a control 
            voltage. VCFs are used to filter the audio signals generated by VCOs 
            in an analog synthesizer in order to create more interesting and 
            textured sounds. <A name=vco></A>
            <P><B>Voltage-Controlled Oscillator</B> - an analog circuit that 
            generates a electrical waveform, such as a Sine, Saw or Square wave 
            where the pitch is determined by a control voltage. VCOs are used by 
            older analog synthesizers to generate the base sounds which are then 
            altered by <A href="#vca"><FONT

            <P><B>VST Plug-In</B> - a program that uses Steinberg's VST 
            technology to obtain digital audio samples which are then 
            manipulated by applying reverb, compression or some other type of 
            audio signal effect. The output signal may be rendered off-line or 
            generated in real-time while the plug-in's host program performs 
            playback. See <A href="#plugin"><FONT
